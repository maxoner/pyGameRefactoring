# pyGameRefactoring
A screensaver that draws a curve on the set anchor points. I have added the ability to delete anchor points, the ability to create multiple curves and change the speed of each curve

## Control
- <kbd>f1</kbd> — Show help
- <kbd>R</kbd> — Reset the anchor points of the current curve
- <kbd>P</kbd> — Pause
- <kbd>Num+</kbd> — More smoothing points
- <kbd>Num-</kbd> — Less smoothing points
- <kbd>→</kbd> — Next curve
- <kbd>←</kbd> — Previous curve
- <kbd>↑</kbd> — Increase speed
- <kbd>↓</kbd> — Decrease speed
- <kbd>esc</kbd> — Quit

This is homework from course [«ООП и паттерны проектирования»](https://www.coursera.org/learn/oop-patterns-python).
